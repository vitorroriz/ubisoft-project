# hangubi
A hangman game based on Ubisoft Blue Byte list of games.

By playing the classic hangman game, you have to reveal names of games that Ubisoft Blue Byte (Ubisoft Dusseldorf) created or help to develop.

This project was created to help me learn HTML/CSS/JS/VUE.

	- Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/vitorroriz/hangubi)

	- Have fun and don't let the man to hang!
